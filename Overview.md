# Challenge Overview

The university were working on a co-designed piece of work to track the success of their new venture selling food on campus via local site-based vendors. To support the desire to track and report, a small team of consultants developed an API. Unfortunately, they shut up shop and left before it was complete. Now we are left with a broken API that is not returning the correct response.

It is your job to go in, as the expert, and fix the API by finding bugs and errors in the code and ensure that the API is functional. It would also be great if you are able to improve the API along the way.

Good Luck and Happy Fixing!
